<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/toolbar.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Toolbar with category picker and filter</p></figcaption></figure>

The toolbar provides two main functions for narrowing down the amount of data displayed.

* Category picker on the left
* Quicksearch on the right

Both tools are present in all datasheet toolbars.&#x20;

Other tools are usually specific to the active sheet. For example:

* [screenshot.md](../screenshot.md "mention")
* [price-importer.md](../price-importer.md "mention")

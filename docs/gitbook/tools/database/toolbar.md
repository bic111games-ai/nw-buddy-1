The toolbar provides two main functions for narrowing down the amount of data displayed.

* Category picker on the left
* Quicksearch on the right

Both tools are present in all datasheet toolbars. Other tools are usually specific to the active sheet.

## Price importer

The price importer tool appears on item and housing tables. This tool opens an importer dialog where you can choose to import from JSON file or from [NW Market Prices](https://nwmarketprices.com/). After completing the import, item data on nw-buddy has metadata for prices updated.&#x20;

This does not enable automatic periodic price update. You have to execute this tool whenever you want to see the prices updated.

[NW Market Prices](https://nwmarketprices.com/) is a commynity project and prices are provided by the [NWMP community](https://nwmarketprices.com/).&#x20;

# Database

The largest section of the side menu is occupied by the database tables. Almost all of them share the same concept and functionality.

### Toolbar

The toolbar provides two main functions for narrowing down the amount of data displayed.

* Category picker on the left
* Quicksearch on the right

Both tools are present in all datasheet toolbars. Other tools are usually specific to the active sheet.



### Data View

The main view is obviously the data view itself. Tools that can be used here are

Drag and reorder the columns

Sort by specific column

Filter columns. Depending on the column configuration, this can be a simple text filter or a more complex conditional filter that allows a combination of multiple AND, OR, NOT conditions.

#### Item Tracker

Inside the table, a special column shows 3 stars that can be switched on and off. They are used to bookmark items. The interpretation of the stars is up to the user. When a star is activated, the items will appear in the tracking system.

#### NWDB Info links

The leftmost column is usually an icon that links to NWDB info and displays an NWDB tooltip.

### Detail View

When an item is selected in the table, a detail view appears on the right with more detailed information. Common functions here are

* Tracking stars
* Icon is again NWDB Info link and tooltip
* Title is nw-buddy internal link

This pattern of functionality is repeated throughout the application.

### Reset State

After a session, the data view may end up with multiple filters set and columns reordered.

To reset these, use the drop-down menu and reset either the filter or the column state, or both.

The column state needs to be reset from time to time, as the state is persisted and restored across browsing sessions. When new columns are introduced, they may not appear until they are either manually enabled or the state is reset.

# Database

The largest section of the side menu is occupied by the database tables. Almost all of them share the same core concept and functionality.

### Toolbar

The toolbar provides two main functionalities to narrow down the amount of data you see.

* Category picker on the left
* Quicksearch on the right

Both tools are present in all datasheet toolbars. Other tools are usually specific to the datasheet you are looking at



### Data View

The main view is obiously the data view itselt. Tools you can use here are

Drag and reorder the columns

Sort by specific Column

Filter columns. Depends on the column configuration it may have a silmple text filter or a more complex conditional filter attached that allows a combination of multiple AND, OR, NOT confitions.

#### Item Tracker

Inside the table a special column shows 3 stars that can be toggled on and of. Use these to bookmark items. The interpretation of the stars is up to you. If any star is enabled, the items will appear in the tracking system.

#### NWDB Info links

The most left column is usually an icon that links to NWDB info and shows an nwdb tooltip.

### Detail View

When an aitem is selected in the table, a detail view appears on the right with further detaild informations. Common functionalities here are

* Tracking stars
* Icons is again NWDB Info link and tooltip
* Title is nw-buddy internal link.

That functionality pattern is repeated throughout the application.

### Reset State

After a session you might have multiple filters set and columns reordered.

To reset those, use the menu dropdown and reset either filter or column state or both.

The column state needs a reset from time to time as the state is persisted and restored across the browsing sessions. Whenever new columns are introduced, the may not appear until thei either are manually enabled or the state is reset.

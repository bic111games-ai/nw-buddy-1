## Bonus Chance

In this example the craft bonus chance is 40%, meaning after 100 crafted items we may end up with roughly 140 total items.

With the "net/gross" mode button we can switch into the mode where bonus chance is used to reach the goal of 100 items without overshoot.

To increase the bonus chance, profession gear can be chosen from the settings menu

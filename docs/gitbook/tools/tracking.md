# Tracking

The app sidebar has a section dedicated to tracking with different item categories.

On each category page a collection counter and all items that fall into that category are displayed.

Wherever an item display shows three stars, the sars can be used to bookmark the item. A bookmarked item will then be counted as collected or learnt in its specific category. This works throughout the application.&#x20;

The stars have no further meaning to the application and can be used for custom marking and filtering within the table view.&#x20;

Mention: Not all items have a dedicated tracking category, even if they show the bookmark stars.&#x20;

# Tracking

There is an entire section of the side menu dedicated to tracking.

Within each category, a summary view shows all the items available to collect and the current collection counter.

If an item has three stars, it can be bookmarked. A bookmarked item will then be counted as collected or learnt in its specific category, if it falls into one. This works throughout the application.

The stars have no other meaning for the application and can be used for custom marking and filtering within the data view. Note that the bookmarking system is also available for items that do not have a tracking category.

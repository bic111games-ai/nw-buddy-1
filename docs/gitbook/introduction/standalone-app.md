# Standalone App

A Standalone Application is available for download. Releases are hosted on github [https://github.com/giniedp/nw-buddy/releases](https://github.com/giniedp/nw-buddy/releases)

The application does not need an installation and can be launched directly. Unfortunately each release has to be re-downloaded as there is no auto update mechanism yet. However, the app indicates if a new version is available.

Release schedule is slower compared to the website. Since updates have to be re-downloaded, the releases are bundled and updated monthly generally speaking.&#x20;

A word about trust. The app is uncertified, meaning Windows may complain about malicious software. If you are sceptical about it, do not use the app, use the website. All i can say is however, the source is public and can be reviewed. Certifications are expensive, beyond of what i am willing to spend for a hobby project.
